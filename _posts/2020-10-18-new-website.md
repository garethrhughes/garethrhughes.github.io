My last attempt to blog was a few years ago now, I used to regularly blog earlier in my career and it's something I always struggled to maintain as I'm not the best writer. 

So what's different this time? Probably not much but I want to practice writing and be more involved in the Sydney .NET/development community.

So what I plan to write about? I plan to write about any interesting project work, my photography and anything I release as a freelance developer.
