I recently wrote this up on confluence at work. However there is nothing here that's specific to that environment other than it being for AWS. The idea is to have a consistent environment for all the developers on the team to use to make life easier when debugging issues.

This is written for a Mac as my current team are all using Macs but I'm currently running the same setup on Kubuntu.

### Requirements

- [Brew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

### Setup Dependencies

```console
brew tap common-fate/granted
brew install coreutils curl git granted awscli
```

### Setup asdf

```console
git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.13.1
```

Add the following to ~/.zshrc, see [here](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) if not using ZSH.
```console
. "$HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh"
```
You will need to reload your terminal at this point

Add the nodejs plugin & configure defaults

```console
asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
asdf install nodejs latest
asdf global nodejs latest
```

asdf gives a nice way to control the versions of software required on a project level, this is a `nodejs` setup but it also handls other software.

### Assume

Run the `assume` command and follow the installation steps to get the required plugin installed in Firefox.

Once this is completed setup an account with the command

```console
aws configure sso --profile {account/environment name}
```

Complete the setup steps with the correct details then add as many accounts as you need to interact with.

Now the command `assume` will log you in to your terminal and correctly export the AWS credentials and `assume -c` will take you straight to the AWS Console.
