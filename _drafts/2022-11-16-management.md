## Disclaimer

This is not something I was trained in, I developed my management style over the years by watching other successful and sometimes very unsuccessful managers flail about and then through my process of flailing about and figuring things out. 

These are the things 3 (for now) things I've found that work for me, your mileage my vary. This is also something I've struggled to articulate in interviews in the past, and also something that I think most people don't really know how to interview for. 

## Credentials

My first official leadership position was when I moved into the Technical Director role at Helium, I was there for 3 years. The role included running basically anything to do with Software Development and IT support for the company, this was also client facing, so I found myself having to convince clients of what I thought was a good idea for their projects. 

Next up I moved to Domain as a team lead which was a slightly larger team who were more senior (in skill and age) then my team at Helium. After a short stint there I moved with some colleagues to Claim Central / Wilbur where I got to build my own team and processes. 

So after 6 years experience of management, I'm arrogant enough to think I know enough to write this post. 

## 1: Understand the problem

Understand the business requirements and domain before engaging the team and discussing technical solutions. You should be able to field most of the questions the team will have about a new requirement, if not, make an educated guess where possible to keep the conversation going. You can seek clarification around some points after the discussions and regroup if new information is learned that affects the outcomes. 

Prior to engaging the team I find that having a pre-prepared solution, or presenting a solution to the team really helps them understand the business requirements and is a good way to convey your ideas from one tech person to another. I personally like a simple ERD or AWS Architecture diagram is a good way to talk about a problem.

The major caveat here is that the team have to be feel comfortable to question your approach and you need to be comfortable to give up on your approach if a better one is presented. Your solution is merely a starting position for the negotiation with the team and business. 

## 2. Bounded chaos

Establishing boundaries and expectations with the team is essential. Once you've setup your processes and have established your tech stack you can let your team do what they do best and deliver business value. Team engagement with these boundaries is also important, if the team is new you can work with the team to define these rules and processes together. 

Trusting your team to deliver is important, once your team have an environment in which they can get work done you can focus on the rest of your job. You don't need to be the best dev in the room, management is a different set of skills, it's likely that some of the devs in your team will be better developers than you and this is completely fine. Use them. 

The best use of your time is enablement, make sure the team has the processes, information and support needed to do the work required. 
- Work with product management to figure out your roadmap
- Your senior engineers probably don't need much technical advice from you, however you need to make yourself available to clarifying requirements and approach. 
- Your less senior engineers may want more guidance at the implementation level so you might be required to make more technical decisions or pair them with a more senior engineer to work on their problem. 
- Avoid the critical path, you probably wont be able to put as many hours per week into dev work as your team, let them work on the critical path. You don't want to be a blocker. You're playing support. 

## 3. Process is important, but not that important
