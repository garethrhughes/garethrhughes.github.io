## Bio

Hi, my name is Gareth Hughes. I am a .NET, TypeScript and JavaScript developer and Technical Lead based in Sydney, Australia. Currently I work as a team lead at A-Leagues.

I graduated from Sheffield Hallam University in 2008 with BSc (hons) Computing (Software Engineering) and I have over 15 years of industry experience in England and Australia.

I started my career as a web developer working primarily in PHP and JavaScript on Ubuntu. I eventually moved into dotnet and eventually progressed into technical leadership and management.

I am an avid video gamer, love fitness, yoga, very amateur photographer, vegan and am working on becoming more of a writer. I plan to blog about technology, programming, leadership and gaming.
